2. Treatment of Account 

    You will receive one or more sets of Solar project access credentials. You
    will not allow anyone else to use these credentials to access any Solar
    project system. Should You become aware of any such use, You will
    immediately notify the Solar project in the manner specified at
    http://solarphp.com/committers; until such notice is received You will be
    presumed to have taken all actions made using Your credentials. The Solar
    project and its designates will have complete control and discretion
    over capabilities associated with Your credentials and may change them for
    any reason at any time. Your name and email address, or a derivative of
    it, may be visible worldwide via the Internet.
    
3. License Terms 

    Code committed to a Solar repository must be governed by the New BSD
    License, or another license or set of licenses acceptable to the Solar
    project for the Code in question. Other licenses are not acceptable to the
    Solar project until declared so in writing at
    http://solarphp.com/committers. You will verify that committed Code
    contains appropriate boilerplate licensing text.

4. Committing Code Created by Others 

    You may check in Code to a Solar repository that was not written by
    You, provided that:
    
    a) The checkin comment contains information (or references to information)
       sufficient to identify the author of the Code, including at minimum an 
       email address; and
    
    b) You make all reasonable and appropriate efforts to ensure that such
       Code conforms to the terms of this agreement.
    
5. Cryptography 

    You understand that cryptographic Code may be subject to government
    regulations with which the Solar project and/or entities using such Code
    must comply. Any Code which contains any of the items listed below must
    either be checked-in to a module explicitly identified as containing
    cryptography, or must not be checked in until the Solar project has been
    notified and has approved such contribution in writing.

    a) Cryptographic capabilities or features; or 
    
    b) Calls to cryptographic features; or 
    
    c) User interface elements which provide context relating to cryptography;
       or
    
    d) Code which may, under casual inspection, appear to be cryptographic.

6. Notices and Knowledge 

    By contributing Code, You confirm that, to the best of Your knowledge,
    that Code does not violate the rights of any person or entity.
    
    If You contribute Code on behalf of Your employer, then You must confirm
    that an appropriate representative of that employer has authorized the
    inclusion of such Code in a Solar repository under the terms of this
    agreement.

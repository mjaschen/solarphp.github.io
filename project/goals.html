                <h1>Project Goals</h1>

<h2>Clear and Consistent</h2>

<p><strong>Solar classes should be easy to comprehend and consistently implemented.</strong></p>

<p>Nobody wants to learn how to use another system; most developers prefer to
spend their time writing their own tools, not conforming to someone else's
ideas. I think that is because most code is written without taking the
audience into consideration (the "audience" being other developers).</p>

<p>Because reading code from other developers is a learning experience, all Solar
classes are written as a teaching experience. This means that Solar classes
are written as simply and clearly as possible without any tricky or obtuse
techniques.</p>

<p>Solar classes consistently use shared implementation ideas and are written
according to a common style guide. Each component in the project "looks" and
"feels" like it is part of an overarching and consistent design. (The book
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical Man-Month</a>
calls this aspect "conceptual integrity".)</p>

<p>Finally, Solar classes are named and structured according the vocabulary established by
<a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a>.
This means that anyone familiar with design pattern terminology should be able
to quickly discern which classes perform which functions.</p>

<h2>Teaching/Learning Community</h2>

<p><strong>The community of Solar users should be respectful and cordial to encourage
problem-solving and idea exchange, not ego-boosting, point-scoring, or
one-upmanship.</strong></p>

<p>The social aspect of development is often overlooked or under-rated. In Solar,
we recognize that support and encouragement from other developers is a good
and necessary component of successful projects. Again, this is because all
development is a learning experience, so we should foster a teaching
environment for that experience.</p>

<p>Thus, while providing a mailing list and wiki for collaboration, we want to
maintain a polite and cordial atmosphere both for established developers and
for new users. The primary social rule in all public communication around
Solar is to <a href="/project/be-nice">be nice</a>.</p>

<h2>Global Collaboration</h2>

<p><strong>Solar classes should be fully name-spaced, self-contained, and localizable.</strong></p>

<p>Although English is the de-facto language of developers worldwide, end-users
don't want to see English-only labels, buttons, and text. Solar classes come
with easy built-in text localization so that it's easy to translate into
languages other than English.</p>

<p>Solar is probably not the only PHP class library you are going to use. Because
Solar classes are always named with a <code>Solar_</code> prefix, you never need to worry
about name conflicts or collisions from other libraries. Similarly, any
classes you build for yourself should have a unique namespace prefix (often
called the <code>Vendor_</code> prefix in the documentation).</p>

<p>Solar-based applications should be self-contained; this means no external
dependencies, and all internal dependencies should resolve themselves. In
practice, this means that all Solar classes are distributed in a single
package.</p>

<h2>Separation of Concerns</h2>

<p><strong>Solar classes should adhere to model, view, and controller separation.</strong></p>

<p>Only one Solar class generates output in the normal course of execution: the
Solar_View class. Other Solar classes may access, manipulate, and return data,
but they may not output it; output is solely in the realm of the "view" in a
model/view/controller application, and Solar_View is the only "view" class in
the standard Solar distribution.</p>

<p>In addition, this makes it easy to write applications that are theme-aware.
Because all output passes through a template, the template can be modified to
present the data in any way preferred by the developer.</p>

<p>(Note that we said "in the normal course of execution" above; exceptions and
various debug tools will generate output, but of course that's not the normal
course. :-)</p>

<h2>Useful Documentation</h2>

<p><strong>Solar classes should be well-documented; this means real narrative
documentation on how to use Solar, not just class descriptions.</strong></p>

<p>Because developers generally find it less-rewarding, initially, to spend time
learning someone else's code, all Solar packages will have extensive
end-user documentation. Solar classes also have extensive inline comments to
guide the reader while examining code, and we aim to provide extensive
narrative documentation as well via this site.</p>

<h2>Solid Implementation</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Runs cleanly under <a href="http://php.net">PHP 5</a> with E_ALL and E_STRICT error
reporting;</p></li>
<li><p>Class- and object-oriented, not function-oriented, with full name-space
separation;</p></li>
<li><p>Provides easy-to-use secure-programming elements and a secure foundation
to work from;</p></li>
<li><p>Provides a common means for loading, instantiating, and configuring
classes automatically;</p></li>
<li><p>Provides a common configuration system for Solar classes and for
applications built on Solar components;</p></li>
<li><p>Provides basic library class components (authentication, database, cache,
log, debug, forms, validation, etc) commonly used in web applications;</p></li>
<li><p>Provides easy application distribution in shared environments.</p></li>
